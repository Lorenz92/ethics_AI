# Reply to: Life and death decisions of autonomous vehicles

* These results roughly agree with the Moral Machine results on some dimensions (for example, the weak preference for inaction), and disagree on others (for example, the preference for saving children), but the differences between the two methods, measures and statistical analyses make any direct comparison difficult.
* Each approach comes with its own limitations, and its own usefulness. The Moral Machine approach allows us to measure the weight of different moral priorities when pitted against each other, rather than considered in isolation; but participants cannot explicitly state that one dimension (for example, age) should not be taken into account. Of course, since each scenario involved at least two moral dimensions, respondents could avoid making decisions based on dimensions they felt should not be programmed into the cars. Participants who believed that the vehicle should be blind to age, for instance, could endeavour to be systematically blind to age themselves in how they responded to the scenario pairs. Had millions of participants made this choice, this would have statistically resulted in an absence of a preference for age, and it would have ranked at the bottom of the list of the nine moral dimensions we tested. It remains, however, that individuals had no opportunity to explicitly express this preference for equality.
* The approach used by Bigman and Gray does offer participants the opportunity to explicitly express a preference for equality. One limitation of this approach is that measurement becomes sensitive to social desirability, experimental demands and framing effects (which is not to say that other methods do not have this problem).
* SLIDER -> This is, in essence, the method used by Bigman and Gray—except that it uses a continuous measure rather than a three-point scale and does not use a textual description for the midpoint of the scale.
* Here we see the value of giving people the opportunity to express an explicit preference: While their scenario-based choices may well show an implicit bias against lower-status victims, the users would probably be unhappy if this bias was actually acted on.

## Glossary

* Social desirability -> Social desirability is the tendency of some respondents to report an answer in a way they deem to be more socially acceptable than would be their "true" answer. They do this to project a favorable image of themselves and to avoid receiving negative evaluations.
* Experimenter demand -> Experimenter demand effects refer to changes in behavior by experimental subjects due to cues about what constitutes appropriate behavior. We argue that they can either be social or purely cognitive, and that, when they may exist, it crucially matters how they relate to the true experimental objectives.
* Framing effect -> The framing effect is a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations; e.g. as a loss or as a gain.

## Notes

* Concettualmente diverso cambiare la propria preferenza, da esprimere un idea di uguaglianza esplicita.
* Evitare il framing effect con gli slider ma partire con dei dati precalcolati dalle risposte date è comunque partire con un bias esplicitato.
